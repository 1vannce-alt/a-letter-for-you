          <p>To Someone <span class="highlight">Special</span>,</p>
          <p>
            As this year comes to an end, I find myself reflecting on all the
            <span class="highlight">moments</span> that made it truly
            meaningful. And when I think about what brought the most light into
            my days, my thoughts always lead back to
            <span class="highlight">you</span>. There's something about the way
            our paths crossed that still feels like magic—a beautiful twist of
            fate I never saw coming but am so incredibly
            <span class="highlight">grateful</span> for.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="letter-paragraph" data-paragraph="2">
          <p>
            I want you to know that every
            <span class="highlight">conversation</span> we've had, every laugh
            we've shared, and even the comfortable silences in between—they all
            mean more to me than words could ever express. You have this
            effortless way of making ordinary moments feel
            <span class="highlight">extraordinary</span>. Whether we're talking
            about nothing or everything, time with you always feels like a gift
            I didn't know I needed.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="letter-paragraph" data-paragraph="3">
          <p>
            Our <span class="highlight">journey</span> together, wherever it may
            lead, has already taught me so much. You've shown me what it means
            to genuinely enjoy someone's presence, to look forward to a simple
            message, and to feel my heart smile at the thought of someone. I
            don't know exactly what the
            <span class="highlight">future</span> holds, but I do know that
            having you in my life has made the present so much brighter.
          </p>

        <div class="letter-paragraph" data-paragraph="4">
          <p>
            I'm not in a rush. Good things take
            <span class="highlight">time</span>, and you're one of those good
            things I'd wait for—no matter how long it takes. What we have, this
            beautiful connection that's still unfolding, is something I want to
            <span class="highlight">treasure</span> and nurture. I believe in
            us, in the way we understand each other, and in the possibility of
            something truly wonderful blooming between us.
          </p>

        <div class="letter-paragraph" data-paragraph="5">
          <p>
            Thank you for being <span class="highlight">you</span>—for your
            kindness, your warmth, and for the way you make me want to be a
            better person. Thank you for giving me something to
            <span class="highlight">hope</span> for and someone to believe in.
            You may not know just how much you've touched my life, but I hope
            this letter lets you see even a glimpse of what you mean to me.

            As we step into a new year, I carry with me the
            <span class="highlight">hope</span> that our story is just
            beginning. Whatever comes next, I want you to know that I'm here,
            cheering you on, caring for you, and
            <span class="highlight">waiting</span>—patiently and
            wholeheartedly—for whatever beautiful chapter we're meant to write
            together.
