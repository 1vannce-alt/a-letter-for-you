          <p>Hi my dear <span class="highlight">Clabelle</span>,</p>
          <p>
            As this year comes to a close and we step into a new one together, I
            find myself feeling <span class="highlight">grateful</span> in ways
            I never really expected. Murag every ending naturally makes you look
            back, but this time, when I did, I realized how much of my year had
            <span class="highlight">you</span> in it. And honestly, it made me
            smile. It made me feel calm. It made me feel thankful that somehow,
            we are entering another year with each other still here.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="letter-paragraph" data-paragraph="2">
          <p>
            I just want to start this new year by telling you how much I
            <span class="highlight">appreciate</span> you. Like sincerely, from
            a place that's quiet but very real. You became such an important
            part of my life, not because of big promises or dramatic moments,
            but because of <span class="highlight">consistency</span>. The way
            you stayed. The way you existed in my days. Murag slowly, you became
            someone I looked forward to, someone who made things feel lighter
            just by being there.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="letter-paragraph" data-paragraph="3">
          <p>
            I appreciate you in ways that are hard to put into words. I
            appreciate your <span class="highlight">presence</span>, your
            thoughts, your personality, and the way you make conversations feel
            natural. I appreciate even the smallest moments we share. The random
            talks, the simple updates, the times when nothing special was
            happening but it still felt
            <span class="highlight">meaningful</span> because it was with you.
            Those moments mattered to me more than you probably know.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="letter-paragraph" data-paragraph="4">
          <p>
            As we move into this new year, I realize that one of the things I'm
            most thankful for is knowing that I still get to have you in my
            life. Murag reassuring kaayo ang thought nga we're still here, still
            talking, still choosing to
            <span class="highlight">understand</span> each other. And honestly,
            that's something I don't take lightly.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="letter-paragraph" data-paragraph="5">
          <p>
            I know we're not official, and I know things are still taking their
            time. But I want you to know that my feelings are
            <span class="highlight">steady</span> as always. Not siya rush, not
            siya pressure. It's just consistent care and appreciation for you.
            I'm happy walking into another year with you at this pace, as long
            as it's something we're both comfortable with. Bitaw, being
            <span class="highlight">patient</span> feels easier when it's you.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="letter-paragraph" data-paragraph="6">
          <p>
            What I feel is not just about this year or the next. It's about the
            idea of more <span class="highlight">time</span>. More
            conversations. More shared moments. More growth together. When I
            think about the future, murag natural ra jud nga I imagine you still
            being there, not necessarily in a perfect or ideal way, but in a
            real and <span class="highlight">honest</span> one. The kind where
            we continue learning, understanding, and choosing each other little
            by little.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="letter-paragraph" data-paragraph="7">
          <p>
            You <span class="highlight">inspire</span> me to be better without
            even trying. You make me more patient, more thoughtful, and more
            intentional. And knowing that I get to carry that into this new
            year, and hopefully the years after that, means so much to me. Like
            ikaw ang reason nganong I want to keep improving jud clab, not just
            for someone else, but for myself too.

        <div class="letter-paragraph" data-paragraph="8">
          <p>
            There were moments this past year when things were unclear, when
            emotions were quiet, when I chose to understand instead of question.
            And even then, my appreciation for you never changed. If anything,
            it became <span class="highlight">deeper</span> and more grounded.
            Mas ni kalma siya, mas ni tinuod. And that's the kind of feeling I'm
            bringing with me into this new year and the years ahead.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="letter-paragraph" data-paragraph="9">
          <p>
            As we welcome this new chapter, I wish you
            <span class="highlight">happiness</span>, peace, and success in
            everything you do. I hope this year brings you moments that make you
            proud of yourself, moments that make you laugh freely, and moments
            that remind you of how <span class="highlight">valuable</span> you
            are. I hope life becomes gentler with you, because you deserve that,
            kaayo.

            And if the coming years allow us to keep walking forward
            <span class="highlight">together</span>, even quietly, even slowly,
            I'll be thankful for every step. I'll appreciate every moment we
            share, no matter how simple. Because for me, it's never been about
            rushing toward something. It's about
            <span class="highlight">staying</span>, choosing, and growing
            together over time.

            Thank you for being someone I genuinely care about. And thank you
